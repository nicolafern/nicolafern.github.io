   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been experimenting with equipment and techniques in filming lately.  Last week, I shot a 90 minute video of the entrance to the chemotherapy department at the hospital I work at, and compressed it down to 55 seconds (with a speed increase of 10,000% - this seemed to give the best results).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was shot on a Canon XA20 camcorder, set to cinema mode and manual focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the tripod pretty much as high as it would go, and the camera at a slight angle, to get the bulk of the building in shot, with a good amount of sky, while also avoiding the actually pretty extensive construction barriers and activities going on to the right of the shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I particularly like how the light and sky reflects off the building windows, and the crane movements.  I think it’s a pretty effective representation of the life of the building, and is nice and dynamic.  It will probably be used for cutaways and intro sequences for some of the other videos we are producing at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Steve Austin: Astronaut. A man barely alive. Gentlemen… we can rebuild him. We have the technology. We have the capability to make the world’s first bionic man. Steve Austin will be that man. Better than he was before. Better. Stronger. Faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Rhoda Morgenstern. I was born in the Bronx, New York in December of 1941. I’ve always felt responsible for World War II. The first thing I remember liking that liked me back was food. I had a bad puberty; it lasted seventeen years. I’m a high school graduate. I went to art school. My entrance exam was on a book of matches. I decided to move out of the house when I was twenty-four. My mother still refers to this as the time I ran away from home. Eventually, I ran to Minneapolis, where it’s cold and I figured I’d keep better. Now I’m back in Manhattan. New York, this is your last chance!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. David Banner: physician; scientist. Searching for a way to tap into the hidden strengths that all humans have… then an accidental overdose of gamma radiation alters his body chemistry. And now when David Banner grows angry or outraged, a startling metamorphosis occurs. The creature is driven by rage and pursued by an investigative reporter. The creature is wanted for a murder he didn’t commit. David Banner is believed to be dead, and he must let the world think that he is dead, until he can find a way to control the raging spirit that dwells within him.&lt;/p&gt;
